## Fundamentals of Derivatives Transactions
### Futures Transactions
A person buying a contract is **obligated** to buy the underlying commodity at the contract price from the seller **on the expiration date**. Conversely, a person selling a contract is obligated to sell the underlying commodity at the contract price to the buyer on the expiration date.

**Net cash settlement**
a settlement method whereby only a difference between the “futures price at the time of purchase (or sale)” and the “futures prices at the time of settlement” is delivered.

The reason for net cash settlement is that a share price index is an abstract thing for which it is impossible to deliver the actual shares, and thus the underlying product in a share index futures transaction cannot be physically delivered.

The “least expensive bond” refers to the bond for which the amount calculated by the formula, “futures price × conversion factor – spot price,” is the smallest.

**Characteristics**
* An Offsetting (Equal and Opposite) Trade Can Be Executed at Any Time
* Difference from Margin Trading
  * There Is No Borrowing and Lending Relationship in Futures Transactions
  * In Futures Transactions, Futures Prices Are Determined Independently from Spot Transactions


## Options Transactions
An options transaction is a transaction in which one purchases or sells the right to buy or sell
a specified financial product (underlying securities or underlying assets) at a specified price
(known as the **“exercise price**” or “**strike price**”) by a specified future date, regardless of the
market price of that underlying securities at the time.

### Call Option
right to purchase the underlying securities

### Put Option
right to sell the underlying securities

* cost of the option
* usually **paid at the beginning of the transaction by the seller** to the buyer
